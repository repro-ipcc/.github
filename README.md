# Project to Ensure the Reproducibility of IPCC Report Figures

[https://www.ipcc.ch/](IPCC) produces reports on Climate Change containing figures to summarize its findings. This organization helps reuse these figures making sure the data and code to produce these figures is reproducible.

Most of the code and data to generate the figures is available in the https://github.com/IPCC-WG1 organization. Unfortunately, most of the figures are not as easy to reproduce as expected, needing specific package installations, instructions, and sometimes missing data. 

## Participants

This project was started at Inria Saclay and Universit√© Paris-Saclay in 2024, and several other organizations and people have joined.
